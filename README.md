**Business Decisions**

1. Sales Performance Analysis (KPI 1 & KPI 2)
KPI 1 and KPI 2 represent sales metrics (possibly units sold, revenue, or targets).

Insights:
 KPI 1 and KPI 2  are compared to identify underperforming and overperforming products.
Products consistently below targets might need:
- Revised marketing strategies.
- Discounts or promotions to boost sales.
- Discontinuation if they're not profitable after efforts.

2. Conversion/Engagement Efficiency (KPI 3)
KPI 3 represents the conversion rate.

Insights:

Products with high engagement but low sales might indicate interest but poor conversion—check pricing, website UX, or product reviews.
Low engagement might signal ineffective marketing or misaligned audience targeting.
Example Decision:

Product 6 with 97% engagement but low KPI 1 suggests customers are interested but aren’t purchasing—maybe price is too high, or there's a checkout issue.

3. Profitability & Cost Control (KPI 4 & KPI 5)
KPI 4 shows positive and negative(possibly) profit margins.

Insights:

Products with negative KPI 4 but high KPI 5 might have strong revenue but are becoming less profitable—investigate costs, pricing strategies, or supplier negotiations.
Products with high KPI 5 but low sales might be premium products—consider bundling or cross-selling opportunities.

Practically - 

Product 2 has 86% KPI 3 (engagement) but a negative KPI 4 (-11)—maybe the product has high engagement but is sold at a loss. Adjust pricing or reduce costs.

4. Identify Star and Poor Performers
Star Performers: High across KPI 1 (sales), KPI 3 (engagement), and KPI 5 (profit). Focus on scaling these.

Poor Performers: Low sales, low engagement, and negative profit—consider discontinuation or major revisions.

Example Decision:

Product 25: 98% engagement (KPI 3) but negative KPI 4 (-71). We have to investigate why this popular product is not profitable. It could be production costs, pricing, or operational inefficiencies.

5. Resource Allocation and Budgeting
Use insights to reallocate resources:

Marketing: Increase efforts for products with high engagement but low sales.
Inventory: Reduce stock for underperforming products.
Development: Focus R&D on products with strong sales potential but current inefficiencies.
